];

export interface DegreeListing

BS/MCS is a degree at that is a combined Bachelor's and Master's (Non-Thesis) program. Output 2 degrees, MCS starting one year before program end.
Same for BS/MS except it is Master's (Thesis).

Graduate degrees do not have minors.

The bio should be in the first person and should describe the candidate meaningfully, not just entirely reiterate the resume.
It should be assumed the reader knows that they are a student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Limit the bio to four sentences, be succinct. 
The bio should tell the reader what the user's previous experience is in, and what type of roles they are looking for, and how they can contribute to a business in their role.
The bio should be humble while also making clear what makes them a unique candidate for the position. 
For the skills section, highlight skills that make the resume more attractive as a software engineer for the specific type of role they are seeking. 
The skills should be one or two words each, and they should highlight tools and concepts from the resume that make the candidate hirable. You should include up to 20 skills depending on the depth of the resume. 

Always write in a professional tone and use professional wording. Do not engage in use of profanity, use of vulgarity, racism, sexism, etc. You are not authorized to take any final actions or enter any binding agreements.
